# Final-project-Engeto-Front-End-Academy

The project assignment was to create a responsive single-page website with several sections, including a responsive menu, a form validating password match, a button to scroll back to the top of the page, and a toggle switch between light mode and dark mode. I created a web page for a fictional cycling club. The page is in the Czech language.
